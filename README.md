In this simple application, originally we have a photo in the center. 
If we double tap on the photo, it zooms to full screen size.
There is a scroll bar at the bottom of the screen to indicate the location of the current view.
If you rotate the phone on its Y-axis, the photo is moving as you rotate.
Enjoy this little function!
