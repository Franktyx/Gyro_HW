# Gyroscope Photo Viewer

A simple gyroscope feature added when you view your photos.</br>
There are basic gestures you can control on the photo, including double tap, pinch and pan gestures.</br>
When the photo is zoomed in, you can tilt your phone left and right to scroll the photo to left and right.</br>
Enjoy this fancy feature!
